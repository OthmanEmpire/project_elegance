## Elegance--Computer Vision with C. Elegans

The project "Elegance" mainly involves data visualization of parameters that 
describe Caenorhabditis Elegans (roundworm) such as trajectories during 
locomotion. 

Elegance is broken down into several parts which in chronological order are:
1. 2D image filtering to isolate the C. Elegans from background noise
2. 3D reconstruction of the C. Elegans from the filtered 2D images 
3.
