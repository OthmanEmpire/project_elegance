## Elegance--Computer Vision with C. Elegans

The project "Elegance" aims to visualize some behavioural data of the worm
(Caenorhabditis Elegans). Namely, the project was aimed to track the worm in
a series of images and draw two heat maps: a heat map of it's the time
duration per location and a heat map of how many visits for a given location.

Project "Elegance" was one of the projects in a summer internship and was
unfortunately halted since it was no longer needed.


## Key Features
* Tracking of the worm using several image filtering techniques
* Pre-rendering of 2D tracked images
* Animation of the series of 2D images using pyqtgraph
* Generation of test images to apply tracking algorithms on


## Requirements
* Python 2.6
* OpenCV 3.1.0
* pyqtgraph  0.9.10
